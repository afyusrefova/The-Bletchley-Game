Description:
Hello user, I will tell you more about our game.
The Germans place a combination of 4 random digits in the range between 0 and 7,
that indicate the coordinates of their battleships. You are the code breaker. You should guess the
number within 13 lives using the board. You place your guesses. The
Germans should give an answer with tables whether only a number is guessed or a number with its number
position. If the code breaker reaches the 13th try and has not guessed the combination the game 
is over and The Germans win.
